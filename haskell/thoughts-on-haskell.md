# Thoughts on Haskell

## Day one

- Feels similar in many ways to F#.
- Having different function overloads for different cases feels nice syntactically, but also feels less safe.
- List comprehensions are nice.

## Day two

- `.` is quite nice, but not as nice as `|>`
- Generic map/sort/filter functions are cool.
- Lazy evaluation with linked lists enables some quite elegant code.

## Day three

- Haskell's error messages are pretty inscrutable. I feel like I should be in a good place to cover the basics of use of monads given my experience with F#, but it proved challenging. What the hell does `(if ... then ... else ...)-syntax in pattern` mean?
