# Ruby

## Thoughts

### Day 1

- Don't really get the function name 'puts' for printing to the console.
- Interesting that numbers are classes.
- I like `unless` and `until` (opposite behaviour of `if` and `while`).
- Funny working in dynamically-typed language and seeing undeclared variables being fine if the code path doesn't hit them!
- Nice to see some strong typing; JavaScript's type coercion scares me!
- duck typing is cool.
