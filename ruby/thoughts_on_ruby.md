# Ruby

## Thoughts

### Day 1

- 'puts' and 'gets' for writing to and reading from stdout is interesting. A bit more vivid than usual.
- Interesting that numbers are classes.
- I like `unless` and `until` (opposite behaviour of `if` and `while`).
- Funny working in dynamically-typed language and seeing undeclared variables being fine if the code path doesn't hit them!
- Nice to see some strong typing; JavaScript's type coercion scares me!
- duck typing is cool.
