# Ruby

## Thoughts

### Day 1

- 'puts' and 'gets' for writing to and reading from stdout is interesting. A bit more vivid than usual names.
- Cool that you can put if/unless at the end of lines! Reads a bit more like English.
- Interesting that numbers are classes.
- I like `unless` and `until` (opposite behaviour of `if` and `while`).
- Funny working in dynamically-typed language and seeing undeclared variables being fine if the code path doesn't hit them!
- Nice to see some strong typing; JavaScript's type coercion scares me!
- duck typing is cool.

### Day 2

- Didn't pick up on this yesterday - nice that functions don't have to be associated to classes!
- Feels kind of weird having one collection type (arrays) with the behaviour for queues, linked lists, stacks and sets. Convenient in a way, but must be hard to optimise.
- :symbols are interesting as an easily-defined singleton.
- Using hashes for named params is cool.
- Intesresting that it's possible to extend classes with new functions.
- Like that code blocks can be passed around as first-class objects (yield/.call).
- Mixins are interesting. It's kind of like having interfaces with extension methods, all neatly defined in once place.
- Feels weird that collect and map are the same.
- Don't like the name 'inject' for fold/reduce, but good to know that it's available.
- Having methods on strings like 'include?' that take Regexps is nice.
