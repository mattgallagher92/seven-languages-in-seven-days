# Thoughts on Clojure

## Day one

- Seems practical and pragmatic.
- Prefix notation takes some getting used to, but I can see the benefits! I particularly like that how I read the code is so similar to how the code is evaluated.
- I like keywords! Weird but useful that they can be used like functions for lookups; guess there's maybe a protocol that makes that work?
- Looks like there's a good assortment of basic collections.
- Function definition seems fairly simple; using different collection types to distinguish between parameters and the body is a nice quality-of-life choice.

## Day two

- Lack of tail-recursion optimisation is a slight annoyance.
- Sequence functions seem fully featured.
- I like the left-to-right operator (`->>`); it feels like pipelines in F#!
- Protocols and records seem sensible.
- Using maps in place of types (e.g. for stubbing during testing) seems like an interesting idea.
- Macros and macro expansion look very powerful ðŸ‘€
